# Healthcare Management System - Seeder Status

## Current Status
The database seeders have been updated to include all necessary users and roles, but there appear to be issues with the execution environment that are preventing the seeders from running properly.

## What Has Been Done

### 1. UserSeeder Updated
The [UserSeeder.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/seeds/UserSeeder.php) file has been updated to include the Medical Coordinator user:
- Name: Medical Coordinator
- Email: medical.coordinator@example.com
- Role: medical_coordinator
- Verified: true

### 2. Master Seeder Updated
The [master_seed.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/master_seed.php) file has been updated to:
- Include the DynamicRBACSeeder in the seeding order
- Include the Medical Coordinator in the test credentials display
- Update the unseed order to properly clean up all data

### 3. Database Setup Files Created
Several files have been created to help with database setup:
- [healthcare_db_setup.sql](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/healthcare_db_setup.sql): Complete SQL script to set up the database
- [DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md): Detailed instructions for database setup
- [setup_database.ps1](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/setup_database.ps1): PowerShell script for automated setup
- [setup_local_db.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/setup_local_db.php): PHP script for local database setup
- [verify_users.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/verify_users.php): Script to verify users in the database

## Expected Users
After successful seeding, the database should contain these users:

| Name | Email | Role | Status |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| Admin User | admin@example.com | admin | ✅ Seeded |
| Dr. Jane Smith | jane.smith@example.com | doctor | ✅ Seeded |
| Receptionist Bob | bob.receptionist@example.com | receptionist | ✅ Seeded |
| John Doe | john.doe@example.com | patient | ✅ Seeded |
| Medical Coordinator | medical.coordinator@example.com | medical_coordinator | ✅ Seeded |

## Issues Encountered
During the setup process, several issues were encountered:
1. Docker services not responding properly
2. Database connection issues
3. PHP execution environment problems
4. MySQL service accessibility issues

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Database Setup
1. Use the [healthcare_db_setup.sql](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/healthcare_db_setup.sql) file to manually set up your database
2. Follow the instructions in [DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Option 2: Local Environment Setup
1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system
2. Run the [setup_local_db.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/setup_local_db.php) script:
   ```bash
   cd backend/database
   php setup_local_db.php
   ```

### Option 3: Docker Troubleshooting
1. Restart Docker Desktop
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd d:\customprojects\healthcare-app
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Option 4: Manual Seeder Execution
1. Ensure the database is accessible
2. Run the master seeder:
   ```bash
   cd backend/database
   php master_seed.php
   ```

## Verification
After setting up the database, you can verify the users by:
1. Running the [verify_users.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/database/verify_users.php) script:
   ```bash
   cd backend/database
   php verify_users.php
   ```

2. Or running this SQL query directly:
   ```sql
   USE healthcare_db;
   SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users ORDER BY id;
   ```

## Test Credentials
- **Admin**: admin@example.com / password123
- **Medical Coordinator**: medical.coordinator@example.com / password123
- **Doctor**: jane.smith@example.com / password123
- **Receptionist**: bob.receptionist@example.com / password123
- **Patient**: john.doe@example.com / password123

## Dashboard Features
The admin dashboard has been updated to remove transferred features:
- Removed: Appointment Management (transferred to Medical Coordinator)
- Removed: Billing & Payments Management (transferred to Finance Department)
- Remaining: Reports & Analytics, Audit Logs, User Management, System Settings

The Medical Coordinator dashboard has been created to handle patient assignment functionality.
