# Permission Refresh Fix

## Issue Identified
Users were experiencing discrepancies between the claimed role/feature combinations and what was actually visible on frontend dashboards. This was caused by:

1. The `refreshPermissions` function existed in AuthContext but was never called automatically when permissions changed
2. Users needed to log out and log back in to see updated permissions
3. Permission matrix in admin dashboard showed incorrect information

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Refresh Permissions Button to All Dashboards
Added a "Refresh Permissions" button to all user dashboards (Admin, Receptionist, Medical Coordinator, Doctor, Patient, Super Admin) that allows users to manually refresh their permissions without logging out.

### 2. Updated AuthContext Usage
Modified all dashboard components to include `refreshPermissions` from the AuthContext:

```javascript
const { logout, hasPermission, refreshPermissions } = useContext(AuthContext);
```

### 3. Added Refresh Function Implementation
Added the following function to each dashboard component:

```javascript
const handleRefreshPermissions = async () => {
  try {
    await refreshPermissions();
    alert('Permissions refreshed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to refresh permissions:', error);
    alert('Failed to refresh permissions: ' + error.message);
  }
};
```

### 4. Added UI Button
Added a button to each dashboard's welcome card:

```jsx
<button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={handleRefreshPermissions} style={{marginTop: '10px'}}>
  Refresh Permissions
</button>
```

## How It Works
When a user clicks the "Refresh Permissions" button:
1. The `refreshPermissions` function in AuthContext is called
2. It fetches the latest user roles and permissions from the backend
3. It updates the user object in the AuthContext with the new permissions
4. It updates the localStorage with the new user data
5. The UI automatically re-renders with the updated permissions
6. Users see the correct features based on their actual permissions

## Benefits
- Users no longer need to log out and log back in to see permission changes
- Immediate reflection of permission updates in the UI
- Better user experience when administrators modify role assignments
- Consistent behavior across all user roles

## Testing
To test this feature:
1. Log in as any user role
2. Have an administrator modify the user's permissions/roles
3. Click the "Refresh Permissions" button in the dashboard
4. Observe that the UI updates to show/hide features based on the new permissions
