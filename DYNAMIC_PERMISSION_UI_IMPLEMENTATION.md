# Dynamic Permission-Based UI Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic permission-based UI across all role dashboards in the healthcare application. The implementation ensures that UI components are only visible to users who have the appropriate permissions, making the application more secure and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Enhancement
- Added `getUserRoles` method to `RoleController` to fetch user roles and their permissions
- Added API route `/admin/users/{userId}/roles` to expose this functionality
- Fixed route matching logic in the admin-ui API

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Receptionist Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Used `hasPermission` context method to conditionally render action buttons
- Applied guards for:
  - Appointment Management (`appointments.create`, `appointments.read`, `appointments.update`, `appointments.delete`)
  - Scheduling Conflicts (`appointments.resolve_conflicts`)
  - Patient Registration (`front_desk.registration`, `patients.basic_create`, `patients.basic_read`)
  - Patient Check-in (`front_desk.checkin`, `front_desk.queue_management`)
  - Payment Processing (`billing.create`, `billing.read`, `billing.update`, `billing.delete`, `payments.process`)

#### Medical Coordinator Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Applied guards for:
  - Patient Assignment (`patients.assign`, `clinicians.manage_assignments`)
  - Limited Patient History (`patients.read`, `medical_records.limited_read`)

#### Doctor Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Used `hasPermission` context method to conditionally render action buttons
- Applied guards for:
  - Appointments (`appointments.read`, `appointments.update`)
  - Clinical Management (`treatment_plans.create`, `treatment_plans.read`)
  - Patient Management (`patients.read`, `medical_records.read`)
  - Reports (`reports.read`, `analytics.view`)

#### Admin Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Used `hasPermission` context method to conditionally render action buttons
- Applied guards for:
  - System Overview (`system.read`)
  - User Management (`users.manage`)
  - System Configuration (`system.settings`)
  - Escalation Management (`escalations.manage`)
  - Reports & Analytics (`reports.read`)
  - Audit Logs (`audit.read`)
  - Role Management (`roles.manage`)

#### Patient Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Used `hasPermission` context method to conditionally render action buttons
- Applied guards for:
  - Appointments (`appointments.read`, `appointments.create`)
  - Health Overview (`health_metrics.read`, `health_tracking.create`)
  - Medical History (`medical_records.read`)
  - Prescriptions (`prescriptions.read`)
  - Documents & Reports (`documents.read`, `reports.read`)

#### Super Admin Dashboard
- Wrapped all sections with `PermissionGuard` components
- Used `hasPermission` context method to conditionally render action buttons
- Applied guards for:
  - System Role Overview (`system.roles.read`)
  - Dynamic Role Configuration (`system.roles.manage`, `system.roles.create`)
  - Permission Matrix (`system.permissions.manage`)
  - Feature Allocation (`system.features.manage`)
  - System Configuration (`system.settings`)

### 3. Authentication Context Enhancement
- Enhanced `AuthContext` to fetch and store user permissions from the backend during login
- Added `hasPermission` method to check if a user has specific permissions
- Added `refreshPermissions` method to update permissions when they change
- Added manual permission refresh capability to all dashboard components

### 4. API Service Enhancement
- Added methods to fetch user roles and permissions from the backend API
- Added `getUserRoles` and `getRolePermissions` methods

## Testing
- Verified that the new API endpoint `/admin/users/{userId}/roles` is working correctly
- Confirmed that all dashboards now dynamically show/hide components based on user permissions
- Tested that action buttons are only visible when users have the required permissions

## Benefits
1. **Security**: Users can only see and interact with features they have permissions for
2. **Maintainability**: UI automatically adapts when permissions change in the backend
3. **User Experience**: Cleaner interface with only relevant options shown to each user
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new permissions and features without changing UI logic

## Manual Permission Refresh
Added a "Refresh Permissions" button to all dashboards that allows users to manually refresh their permissions without logging out when administrators make changes to role assignments. This feature calls the `refreshPermissions` method in AuthContext which fetches the latest user roles and permissions from the backend.

## Future Improvements
1. Add more granular permissions for each feature
2. Implement permission inheritance for role hierarchies
3. Add audit logging for permission checks
4. Create a permission management UI for administrators
