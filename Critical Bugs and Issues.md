Critical Bugs and Issues
1. Authentication and Token Handling Issues
Problem: The system uses a placeholder JWT implementation that doesn't properly validate tokens.Evidence:
In backend/user-service/UserService.php, the generateJWT() method returns a simple string: "jwt_token_for_user_" . $user['id']
In backend/admin-ui/api.php, the validateJwtToken() function has a comment saying "In a real implementation, you would validate the JWT token signature" but currently only checks for the placeholder format.
Impact: This creates a serious security vulnerability where any user could potentially access the system by crafting a token in the expected format.
Status: FIXED - Implemented proper JWT validation using Firebase JWT library

2. Inconsistent Role Handling Between Frontend and Backend
Problem: The frontend and backend handle roles differently, leading to potential authorization bypasses.Evidence:
In frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js, the hasPermission() function grants all permissions to users with 'admin' or 'super_admin' roles.
However, in backend/shared/rbac/DynamicRBACManager.php, the system uses the dynamic RBAC tables (user_dynamic_roles, dynamic_role_permissions) to check permissions.
The frontend doesn't properly fetch permissions from the backend during login; it attempts to but has fallback logic that could grant incorrect permissions.
Status: FIXED - Updated frontend AuthContext to properly check user permissions and removed automatic admin access grant in backend

3. Hardcoded User Data in Controllers
Problem: Several controllers return hardcoded/mock data instead of fetching from the database.Evidence:
In backend/admin-ui/controllers/AdminController.php, the getDashboard() method returns hardcoded mock data.
The createUser(), updateUser(), and deleteUser() methods in the same controller don't actually interact with the database.
Impact: Administrative functions don't work as expected, creating a disconnect between the UI and actual system state.
Status: FIXED - Updated AdminController to use actual database queries for all operations

4. Incomplete API Implementation
Problem: Several API endpoints are either not implemented or return mock data.Evidence:
In backend/user-service/controllers/UserController.php, the getProfile() method returns placeholder data and the getUserIdFromToken() method returns a hardcoded value.
Several methods in backend/admin-ui/controllers/AdminController.php return mock data instead of interacting with the database.
Status: FIXED - Updated UserController to properly extract user ID from JWT tokens and fetch user data from database

5. Environment Variable Configuration Issues
Problem: Inconsistent environment variable handling between Docker configuration and frontend.Evidence:
In docker-compose.yml, the frontend service has environment variables set, but the actual .env file in the frontend directory may not match.
The REACT_APP_ADMIN_UI_BASE_URL is set to http://localhost:8000/api in both places, but this might not be correct for all deployment scenarios.
Status: FIXED - Standardized environment variables across all deployment methods and created separate .env files for development and production

6. Session Management Issues
Problem: The frontend session management has potential security flaws.Evidence:
In frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js, the session ID is generated client-side and stored in localStorage, which is not secure.
The session timeout mechanism relies on client-side timestamps that can be manipulated.
Status: FIXED - Improved session management by implementing server-side session validation and reducing client-side dependencies

7. Error Handling Inconsistencies
Problem: Error handling is inconsistent across the application.Evidence:
Some API calls in the frontend have comprehensive error handling, while others don't.
The backend sometimes returns HTML error pages instead of JSON responses, which causes parsing errors in the frontend.
Status: FIXED - Updated ApiService to ensure consistent error handling with proper try/catch blocks and JSON response validation

8. Missing Feature Access Implementation
Problem: The role_feature_access table is created but not properly used.Evidence:
In backend/shared/rbac/DynamicRBACManager.php, the getRoleFeatureAccess() method returns an empty array with a comment stating it's no longer used.
However, according to project documentation, this should be used for feature access control.
Status: FIXED - Updated DynamicRBACManager to properly implement feature access controls using the role_feature_access table and updated related controllers and API routes

Recommendations for Fixes
Implement proper JWT validation in both frontend and backend
Fix database interactions in all controllers to use actual database queries
Implement consistent permission checking using the dynamic RBAC system
Remove hardcoded mock data and replace with actual database operations
Improve error handling to ensure consistent JSON responses
Fix session management to use secure, server-side session storage
Implement proper feature access controls using the role_feature_access table
Standardize environment variable configuration across all deployment methods

These issues need to be addressed to ensure the system is secure, functional, and maintainable.
