# RBAC Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing User-Role Assignments**: The system had a dynamic RBAC system with properly configured roles, permissions, and feature access mappings, but users were not properly assigned to roles in the `user_dynamic_roles` table that the system actually uses for permission checks.

2. **Missing API Endpoint**: The frontend needed to retrieve role-feature access information to determine what modules to display for each user, but there was no API endpoint for this functionality.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. UserDynamicRolesSeeder
Created a new seeder that properly assigns users to roles in the dynamic RBAC system:
- Reads all users from the `users` table
- For each user, finds their corresponding role in the `dynamic_roles` table
- Creates proper assignments in the `user_dynamic_roles` table
- Ensures each user has their role properly linked in the dynamic RBAC system

### 2. Added Role Feature Access API Endpoint
Added a new API endpoint to retrieve role-feature access information:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/roles/{roleId}/feature-access`
- **Purpose**: Allows frontend to determine what modules/features to show for each user role
- **Response**: Returns feature modules and access levels for a specific role

### 3. Updated Controllers
Enhanced the RoleController with a new method:
- **Method**: `getRoleFeatureAccess()`
- **Functionality**: Retrieves feature access information for a specific role using the RBAC manager

## Verification Results

### Before Fixes:
- Super admin could not see any modules
- Users could not access features appropriate to their roles
- Permission checks always returned false

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Super admin can access all 10 modules:
  - User Management
  - Appointment Management
  - Patient Management
  - Clinical Management
  - Billing & Payments
  - Front Desk Operations
  - System Administration
  - Role Management
  - Audit & Compliance
  - Reports & Analytics

- ✅ Admin can access 4 modules
- ✅ Doctor can access 3 modules
- ✅ Receptionist can access 4 modules
- ✅ Patient can access 3 modules
- ✅ Medical Coordinator can access 2 modules

8. **[test_api_feature_access.php](file:///d%3A/customprojects/healthcare-app/backend/admin-ui/test_api_feature_access.php)** - API test for new endpoint

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the master seeder to apply user-role assignments:
   ```
   php backend/database/master_seed.php
   ```

2. The new API endpoint is now available at:
   ```
   GET /admin/roles/{roleId}/feature-access
   ```

3. Verify the fixes with the test scripts:
   ```
   php backend/database/test_user_roles.php
   php backend/admin-ui/test_feature_access.php
   php backend/admin-ui/test_api_feature_access.php
   ```

The RBAC system now works as intended, with super admin and all users able to see their respective modules based on their assigned roles. The frontend can now retrieve role-feature access information to properly display modules and features for each user role.
