## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Frontend Changes**: Save files and refresh browser (hot reload available)
2. **Backend Changes**: Save files and restart service container
3. **Database Changes**: Run migrations and seeders as needed
4. **Environment Changes**: Update docker-compose.yml and rebuild containers

### Testing Process
1. **Local Development**: Use npm start for frontend, php -S for backend services
2. **Container Testing**: Use docker-compose for full system testing
3. **Unit Testing**: Run individual service tests
4. **Integration Testing**: Test service interactions through API Gateway

## Deployment Process

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Access application at http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Deployment
1. Update environment variables for production
2. Run database migrations
3. Deploy containers to production environment
4. Verify health checks and functionality

## Future Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. Complete Medical Coordinator Dashboard implementation
2. Add advanced reporting and analytics features
3. Implement telemedicine capabilities

### Medium Priority
1. Mobile application development
2. Enhanced security features (MFA, advanced audit logging)
3. IoT device integration for patient monitoring

### Long-term Vision
1. AI-powered diagnostic assistance
2. Machine learning for predictive analytics
3. Blockchain for secure medical record sharing
4. Integration with external healthcare systems

## Key Documentation Resources

1. **[HEALTHCARE_APP_DOCUMENTATION.md](HEALTHCARE_APP_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Complete system documentation
2. **[DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)** - Guide for making and testing changes
3. **[DOCKER_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md](DOCKER_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Docker build improvements
