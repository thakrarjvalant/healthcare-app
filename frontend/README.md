## Development

### Components

The application is organized into components by feature:

- `components/appointment/` - Appointment booking and management
- `components/billing/` - Billing and invoicing
- `components/clinical/` - Medical records and treatment plans
- `components/notification/` - Notifications
- `components/storage/` - Document storage and retrieval
- `components/user/` - User authentication and profile management

### Pages

Each user role has its own dashboard:

- `pages/patient/` - Patient dashboard and features
- `pages/doctor/` - Doctor dashboard and features
- `pages/receptionist/` - Receptionist dashboard and features
- `pages/admin/` - Admin dashboard and features
- `pages/medical-coordinator/` - Medical Coordinator dashboard and features

### Context

The application uses React Context for state management:

- `context/AuthContext.js` - Authentication state and functions

### Hooks

Custom hooks are used for common functionality:

- `hooks/useApi.js` - API call management
- `hooks/useAuth.js` - Authentication-related functions

### Services

The service layer handles API communication:

- `services/api.js` - Generic API functions
- `services/auth.js` - Authentication-related API calls

### Utilities

Utility functions for common tasks:

- `utils/formatters.js` - Date, currency, and text formatting
- `utils/auth.js` - Authentication helper functions
- `utils/api.js` - API helper functions

## Styling

The application uses CSS for styling with a consistent design system:

- `assets/styles/main.css` - Main stylesheet
- Component-specific CSS files in each component directory

## Routing

The application uses React Router for navigation:

- `routes/AppRoutes.js` - Route definitions

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests

Run end-to-end tests with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Deployment

### Docker

The frontend can be deployed using Docker. See the docker-compose.yml file for configuration.

### Static Hosting

The production build can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Code Quality

### Linting

```bash
npm run format
```

### Coding Standards

- Follow Airbnb JavaScript style guide
- Use functional components with hooks
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components small and focused
- Use PropTypes for type checking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application Not Loading**
   - Check if the development server is running
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify API base URL in environment variables
   - Check browser storage for token
   - Verify user credentials

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Check CSS file imports
   - Verify class names match CSS selectors
   - Check browser developer tools for styling conflicts
